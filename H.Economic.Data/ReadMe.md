# Directory Structure
We have created a way for users to access and update the data repositories that Holos uses. 
Our data is segmented between Crops, and Livestock. However, for now, we will only be uploading the Crop Economic Data.

The Holos data repositories are stored under the `Data` tab, which includes the most up-to-date data, and the sources that the data came from.

To update the data within the Holos Repository, please follow the instructions in the `Templates` tab, and request a commit to the `Data` tab.
