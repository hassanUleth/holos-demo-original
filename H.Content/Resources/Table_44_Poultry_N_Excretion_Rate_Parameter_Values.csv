"1 Daily dry matter intake for pullets estimated based on a typical production period of 19 weeks and values reported in Pelletier (2017): 5.94 t feed per 1,000 pullets produced from a pullet operation.",,,,,,,,,
2 Calculated based on 4 kg total DM intake across 42 days = 0.095 kg head-1 day-1; length of production period from Sheppard et al. (2009a).,,,,,,,,,
 Total DM feed intake was derived from: https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/livestock/production/poultry/basic-feeding-programs-for-small-chicken-flocks.html. The value for broilers was also applied to roasters.,,,,,,,,,
"3 Daily dry matter intake for layers is calculated based on 56 pullets required to produce 1 tonne of eggs in a year, consuming 2 tonnes of feed: 2,000 kg feed / 56 pullets / 365 days = 0.0978 kg feed head-1 day-1",,,,,,,,,
"4 CP content of feed for pullets is a time-weighted average of CP contents across all feeding phases from 0 to 112 days of age (New Life Mills, 2016).",,,,,,,,,
5 Value for CP content of feed for broilers is a body mass-weighted average from Sheppard et al. (2009a). The value for broilers was also applied to roasters.,,,,,,,,,
6 CP content of feed for layers is a time-weighted average derived from Sheppard et al. (2009a).,,,,,,,,,
"7 Calculated as 0.028 * 6.25, where 0.028 kg N kg-1 live weight is the N content of live layers (2.8%, Sheppard et al., 2009a) and 6.25 is the dietary N to dietary protein conversion factor.",,,,,,,,,
8 From Sheppard et al. (2009a).,,,,,,,,,
"9 Calculated as 0.0192 * 6.25, where 0.0192 kg N kg-1 egg is the N content of eggs (1.92%, from Sheppard et al., 2009a) and 6.25 is the dietary N to dietary protein conversion factor.",,,,,,,,,
"10 A default value of 48.50 g egg head-1 day-1 is used; this value is calculated based on a layer producing 0.811 eggs per day and an average egg weight of 59.5 g (Sheppard et al., 2009a).",,,,,,,,,
"11 Initial and final body weights for pullets are from Pelletier (2017) – values for conventional pullet facilities (in Canada, conventional cage systems account for 92.3% of Canadian layers).",,,,,,,,,
12 Final weight for a broiler derived from Let’s Talk Chicken (https://letstalkchicken.ca/farm-to-table/chicken-farm/).,,,,,,,,,
13 Value for final body weight for a roaster is the mid-point for the typical 3-4 kg range reported by Let’s Talk Chicken (https://letstalkchicken.ca/farm-to-table/chicken-farm/).,,,,,,,,,
14 A default production period of 133 days (19 weeks) is used for pullets based on Farm and Food Care Ontario (2016).,,,,,,,,,
15 Length of production period for broilers and layers from Sheppard et al. (2009a).,,,,,,,,,
