"(a) Diameter is the estimated cumulative stem thickness of a multi-stem shelterbelt tree, accounting for the stem thickness of all individual stems, measured at 1.3 m height (breast height) along the stem (from ground level) for all tree species, except for Caragana, for which cumulative stem thickness is estimated from diameters measured at 30 cm height along the individual stems (from ground level). Derived from Amichev et al. (2017).",,,,,,,,,,,,
