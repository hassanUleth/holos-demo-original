1 Values for beef cattle were obtained using feed information included in NASEM (2016). Ym values for beef cattle from IPCC (2019).,,,,,,,,,,,
2 Poor quality (low energy/protein) diets will lead to a negative ADG with growing animals due to the TDN value (?48%).,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Values for beef calves on forage are the same as those for the beef cows, as by default Holos assumes that calves on a forage diet are on the same diets as the cows.",,,,,,,,,,,
"4 Ym values for lactating dairy cows are from ECCC (2022), and are mid-point of the reported 5.5-5.7% average range. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"5 Ym values for dry dairy cows and dairy heifers are from IPCC (2019); for DairyHeifers (Low fiber) and DairyDry (Close-up), the Ym value for backgrounding beef cattle was used.",,,,,,,,,,,
"6 Values for TDN and CP are the same as those for high, medium and low energy/protein diets for beef stocker animals",,,,,,,,,,,
"6 Ym values for sheep diets are from IPCC (2019), Table 10.13 (Table 10.13 proposes a common Ym value for all sheep irrespective of feed quality values)",,,,,,,,,,,
